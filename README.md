folio flat files

## export feature of Folio Views
"File" --> "Export". In "Dateityp" select "Folio Flat File (*.FFF)" option.

"Folio Flat File with ID's (*.FFF)" has IDs for each lines which seem redundand.

"Folio 3.1 Flat File (*.FFF)" seems reduced in comparison to normal "Folio Flat File". It lacks the "Named Popups" section which contains information about the meaning of popups.
